# 🌐 Passport Reader AI

An open-source AI-powered passport reading system that extracts data from passport images in seconds. Built to solve real-world document processing challenges faced by consulates and government offices.

## 🎯 The Problem

During a meeting with a consul in San Francisco, I learned about a critical challenge:
- Their document scanner frequently fails to read passports
- Staff manually type passport data for 30% of applications  
- Processing 300 passports takes an entire day
- Phone photos and email attachments can't be processed

## 💡 The Solution

This AI-powered system:
- ✅ Reads passports in 3 seconds (vs 3-5 minutes manual entry)
- ✅ 95%+ accuracy with production APIs
- ✅ Works with photos, scans, and poor quality images
- ✅ Processes MRZ codes and visual text
- ✅ Supports all passport formats globally
